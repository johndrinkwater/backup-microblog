backup-µblog is a little CLI tool for downloading and storing your twits or
dents.

Running the tool as:
./backup-µblog.py identi.ca user dents/
will fill the dents directory with message/rfc822 files


Known issues/TODO:
Nothing is escaped properly to be valid RFC822, if you’re throwing UTF-8 like a sane person
this programme ignores it and just writes it out. This will be fixed.

Retweeting and replying are ignorant of the domain of that user, because this twitter API
is ignorant of that. Once this supports the OStatus API, that will be fixed.

This only saves your messages, not conversations that you reply to, or messages you receive.

Doesn’t save attachments like images.
